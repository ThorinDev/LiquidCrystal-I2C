# Installation #
Create a new folder called "LiquidCrystal_I2C" under the folder named "libraries" in your Arduino sketchbook folder.
Create the folder "libraries" in case it does not exist yet. Place all the files in the "LiquidCrystal_I2C" folder.

# Usage #
To use the library in your own sketch, select it from *Sketch > Import Library*.
